# 1 Get capsule-, stem-, and root-specific pTHSs except leaf and petal tissue

```
Because BIA related genes are co-expressed in stem, capsule and root, not in leaf or petal!
```

```shell
## manually get stem, capsule and root related peaks from intervene results

cd /mnt/d/ATAC_peak/Intervene_results/sets
cat * > /mnt/d/ATAC_peak/BIA/four_tissue.bed
cd /mnt/d/ATAC_peak/BIA/
sortBed -i four_tissue.bed > four_tissue_sort.bed
```
