# Chromatin-accessibility-landscape-of-Papaver-somniferum

## Introduction

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is one of the oldest and most important medicinal plants worldwide, producing several pharmaceutically important benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) within a tissue specific pattern, including noscapine, morphine, and codeine. With relatively complete studies on genome, transcriptome and biochemical metabolism for P. somniferum, the regulatory mechanisms within epigenomic levels behind active ingredients production as well as tissue specific pattern construction remains unknown. Here, we performed comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) across six distinctive tissues (capsule, stem, fine root, tap root, leaf, and petal) in P. somniferum. Using these data, we wanted to address two main topics: (1) explore tissue-specific control of development for P. somniferum through epigenetic and transcriptional manner; (2) delineate the cis-regulatory motifs and transcription factors that regulate tissue-specific BIA metabolism.
